# Credential Issuer API definition

Swagger that defines how the credential issuer API should behave.

This is an API definition, the purpose is to ease the integration
of the credential backend and frontend.

The code has been autogenerated from the swagger file using this command.

```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/local swaggerapi/swagger-codegen-cli generate -i /local/swagger.yaml -l nodejs-server -o /local/generated-api
```

And after, the code has been modified to add some error cases.
